    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'  // Core compatibility library for modern Android features

    // This library allows for background tasks and scheduling, crucial for automated content posting.
    implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime:2.7.1'  // WorkManager for scheduling tasks efficiently 
    // In this scenario, WorkManager can manage background tasks like posting content at specified times.

    // Add the Retrofit library for making API calls to social media platforms for scheduled content.
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'  // Retrofit for network operations
    // A practical use case would be fetching user content and posting it directly using MadHub's automation tools.

    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'  // Gson converter for handling JSON data
    // This will parse data used in the content scheduler, ensuring seamless communication with social media APIs.

    // Additional library for logging, which aids in debugging and monitoring scheduled tasks.
    implementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.7'  // Memory leak detection during development
    // Workflow step: Utilizing this library ensures efficient memory management while running automated tasks.

    // Support for Kotlin coroutines, allowing for better asynchronous programming.
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.6.0'  // Coroutines for asynchronous tasks
    // In this scenario, coroutines are used to handle background posts without blocking the UI.

    // MadHub SDK for integrating social media management features directly into the application.
    // Practical use case: Automate content posting and management across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
    implementation 'com.madhub:mad-hub-sdk:1.0.0'  // Include MadHub SDK
}

// Note: Make sure your application follows best practices for ethical automation.
// The MadHub features will allow users to efficiently manage their social media presence with ease.
